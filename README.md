**Abstract**

 This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of the Randomized Response (RR) method in
 online and offline group survey settings, focusing on enhancing participants’
 truthfulness when answering sensitive questions. The study investigates the importance
 of surveying environments and the application of the RR method, particularly in online
 settings. After reviewing various RR designs, a specific design for applying the RR
 method in both online and offline group environments was created and tested. The
 results suggest potential differences in respondent honesty between these environments,
 indicating that the RR method may be more effective in digital settings. However,
 limitations such as small sample sizes and non-random assignment of participants are
 acknowledged. The study concludes with a discussion on the implications of these
 findings and provides suggestions for future research, emphasising the need for larger
 sample sizes and randomized participant assignments to enhance result reliability.
